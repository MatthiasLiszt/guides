## Cpu

CPU is short for Central Processing Unit. In the 90's laptops and PCs had usually just one of them. Nowadays everyday computers
are multicore which means that more than one CPU is on a chip. 

The CPU does most of computation and memory manipulations. Please do further readings on wikipedia to understand that better. 
There is a nice programming game called CoreWar which gives you a quick understanding of how a computer and the CPU work.
